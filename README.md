This study-oriented-project was done as part of my academic curriculum at BITS Pilani.

### Abstract
In this report,  a deep study has been conducted on the design of Microstrip Patch Antenna and the role of Artificial Neural Networks in its modeling. A general design procedure is suggested for microstrip antennas based on rectangular patch geometry using artificial neural networks. Both the topics are first studied separately followed by choosing the best algorithms for antenna modeling. As a part of this project, research has been made on the comparison between results obtained using neural networks and experimental results. It is found that Radial Base Function is quite accurate, sufficiently fast and yields satisfactory results.
